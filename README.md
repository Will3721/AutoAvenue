<h1> CIS-5500 Final Project - Used Cars Information</h1>

Provide a user interface to allow users to see the average price of a used car on the used market. A user will be able to query car make and model and the interface will return the average price of the car and the specific prices that it has been sold for. Additionally, a user could use it to see if they are buying a car for a fair price or to see if theyâ€™re selling a car for a fair price. 


CIS550_ETL.ipynb is a Google Colab notebook that was used to process the databases.
