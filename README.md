<h1> CIS-5500 Final Project - AutoAvenue</h1>

Provide a user interface to allow users to see the average price of a used car on the used market. A user will be able to query car make and model and the interface will return the average price of the car and the specific prices that it has been sold for. Additionally, a user could use it to see if they are buying a car for a fair price or to see if theyâ€™re selling a car for a fair price. 

Explore features such as:
* Search - Choose your price range, production year, mileage, and MPG to find a model that fits your needs
* Reviews - See all of the reviews for a particular make and model
* Popular Cars - Check out the most popular cars based on number of ratings
* Efficient Cars - Filter by preferred fuel type and see the most efficient cars of that fuel type
* Hidden Gems - Search for vehicles that are below a certain percentage of the market price and have a minimum rating and number of reviews
